A collection of ReShade shaders. Features primarily depth-dependent stuff. Also gonna be the trash bin for my future shaders.


Disclamer: even though most of the code is mine, some lines/functions (as annotated with comments) come from:

- Well (this) is pretty impressive
  
     A 100% real review (no joke)

This is an SSAO shader and the direct successor to the first version. It's a notch slower but is full resoltuon and as such is much sharper. Unlike MXAO it's meant to be used alongside MVs, but has an extra-filtered mode if you don't want MVs. 

2. SCGI

A GI shader. There's nothing too special. It's meant as a mid- to high-end solution for all things GI. It uses relativly modern tech for some extra quality. Based on Visibilty Bitmasking.
